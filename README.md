## Dependancies:

- deno
  - install deno make sure it's in your path environment variable
- npm
  - _works on node 12 - 16 (not 17)_
  - webpack
  - express

## Set Up
1. Open the terminal
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Go to http://localhost:8080/ on your browser

### Testing:

Install python (recommended 3.7) and use pip to install helim
`pip install helium` ideally in a venv.
Firefox is the default browser it uses to test. Either make sure FireFox is installed or change the first line in `all.py` to `start_chrome()`.

Run `test/all.py` with python i.e. `python3 all.py`

It will give 3 test results outputted in the terminal.

#### The tests are:
- Testing if using hashtags for headers creates a h1 tag in the preview
- Testing if when random text is written and you switch between notes the text is still there
- Testing if creating a new note works (deletes the newly created note after)

CTRL + c in the terminal to stop running.
